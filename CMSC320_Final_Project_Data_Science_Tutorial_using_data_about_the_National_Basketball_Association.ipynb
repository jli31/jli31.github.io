        "### Introduction:\n",
        "The purpose of our project is to deliver a tutorial on the data science life cycle and give an example of how each step is performed. To do this, we decided to look into and collect our initial data from the National Basketball Association, aka the NBA, [one of the biggest industries in Sports Entertainment](https://www.digitalcenter.org/columns/cole-sports-in-media/#:~:text=Second%20on%20the%20list%20of,nine%20years%20with%20the%20NFL.) in the USA. Our goal through using data science was to provide analysis and insight into multiple areas into the NBA. This insight is intended for NBA coaches, players, NBA Award voters, and viewers of the sport in general. In the modern era of the NBA, the average ability of each player is at the maximum the league has ever seen. In other words, [the league is better than ever](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/10/nba-player-athleticism-physicality-evolution/675802/). Each player on an NBA team could have the potential to score 30 points on any given night. Because of this, it has become way harder to distinguish between a good NBA player versus a star NBA player. We want to use the data to understand the current state of the league, compare teams to the league as a whole, and see how players can change over time. We also want to use hypothesis testing and machine learning to help generate better insights and allow us to make predictions.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Why? Well it has been harder than ever for NBA pundits to decide on awards like the MVP, DPOY, or even all-star nominations. We would like to look into strategies that could be put into place to help make those decisions easier, or also just to help the average viewer out there find their next favorite player!\n"

We will query data for individual players or teams. For individual players we can select from 27 different attributes ranging from pts to rebounds to free throw percentage. Teams have 30 different attributes from league to date of game played to points scored among other attributes. There are four different tests that are performed below with their respective graphs. The sections below will go further in depth for what attributes are being tested and the outcomes of the tests."

        "In this next step, we want to use the results, albeit not very many, from the exploratory data analysis and choose some machine learning techniques that might help us answer our initial questions. We will look into two things. Since turnovers didn't seem like it was what was making a team or player bad from the 76ers analysis, we can maybe create a model to predict the three most important and informative stat categories: points, rebounds, and assists. And after that, we can also potentially use a machine learning technique and create a model that can help both viewers and NBA analysts decide how to determine whether or not a player is \"all-star caliber\". For reference, in the exploratory analysis we saw so much parity and longevity with Lebron performing well over his entire career, both in the playopffs and across different teams and ages, and that is the type of player who has been an All-Star 20 times."

The current data is season totals. The reason for this change is that different players might have played a different amount of games and might not be directly comparable. Also, for prediction reasons, it is more useful to train off of per game averages because by the time the season totals are available (at the end of the season), the all star game has already happened."

The $R^2$ values are clearly bad as well, suggesting that not much of the variance in points/rebounds/assists can be explained by minutes played. There must be more exploration done to determine what makes a good playoff performer in the NBA. The Neural Network results are much more conducive to accurate results, clearly!\n",

        "While players statistics can be a great signal, there are many traits that cannot be quantified. We cannot quantify the winning mentaltity or the work ethic that the players have. With that said, statistics allow us to look at the game in a different way. We can use these statistics to gameplan more effectively. We can also use visualizations to see trends in the data. In this project, we learned many valuable lessons.\n",

        "\n",
        "When we create visualizations, we need to present the data in a way that can effectively send a message. If we were generating the data for a coach, the coach does not need to worry about the backend calculations. The coach wants to know what the trend is, so he can make the correct adjustments.\n",

        "When trying to make a machine learning model, we ran into errors. When using linear regression we found the $R^2$ values to be really low. This shows that a regression model is not adequate for this task. It also shows that there may not be the correlation in the data that we initially thought. On the other hand, we found the Neural Network to be very accurate for predicting All-Stars. We found it has a 95% accuracy. This shows that a neural network can be used to accurately classify NBA players into All-Stars and Non-All-Stars.\n",

        "This project was a very cool look into how sports analytics are used. While we only scraped the surface, we did learn many techniques used to implement data analytics into this field. There are many ways we can expand on this project too. We can gather a wider source of data from the NBA API and use some more advanced machine learning techniques to generate insights. We can create different roster combinations and test their effectiveness. We can try and generate a player synergy score to see how well players play together. With data science, we can look at the game of basketball under a completely different lens.\n",

        "Overall, we hope you were able to see the many different steps of the data science lifecycle throughout our project, and also the very important idea that it is a cycle! so there are oftentimes jumps to previous steps if there is new information that a data scientist wants to visit. Data science is a field that is super open-ended and it is completely up to the data scientist to decide what they want to do with the data they collect! It is really just a learning curve in finding the right data, cleaning it, exploring it thoroughly and then finally using that data to build models and make predictions. This will often-times take a lot of effort to get exactly what you want! Thank you for reading through our tutorial :D."
